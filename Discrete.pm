=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides basic functions used in descriptive statistics.
It borrows very heavily from Statistics::Descriptive::Full
(which is included with Statistics::Descriptive) with one major
difference.  This module is optimized for discretized data 
e.g. data from an A/D conversion that 
has a discrete set of possible values.  E.g. if your data is produced
by an 8 bit A/D then you'd have only 256 possible values in your data 
set.  Even though you might have a million data points, you'd only have
256 different values in those million points.  Instead of storing the 
entire data set as Statistics::Descriptive does, this module only stores
the values it's seen and the number of times it's seen each value.

For very large data sets, this storage method results in significant speed
and memory improvements.  In a test case with 2.6 million data points from
a real world application, Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete took 40 seconds 
to calculate a set of statistics instead of the 561 seconds required by
Statistics::Descriptive::Full.  It also required only 4MB of RAM instead of 
the 400MB used by Statistics::Descriptive::Full for the same data set.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $stat = Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete->new();

Create a new statistics object.

=item $stat->add_data(1,2,3,4,5);

Adds data to the statistics object.  Sets a flag so that
the statistics will be recomputed the next time they're
needed.

=item $stat->add_data_tuple(1,2,42,3);

Adds data to the statistics object where every two elements
are a value and a count (how many times did the value occur?)
The above is equivalent to C<< $stat->add_data(1,1,42,42,42); >>
Use this when your data is in a form isomorphic to 
($value, $occurrence).

=item $stat->max();

Returns the maximum value of the data set.

=item $stat->min();

Returns the minimum value of the data set.

=item $stat->mindex();

Returns the index of the minimum value of the data set.  
The index returned is the first occurence of the minimum value.

Note: the index is determined by the order data was added using add_data() or add_data_tuple().
It is meaningless in context of get_data() as get_data() does not return values in the same
order in which they were added.  This behavior is different than Statistics::Descriptive which
does preserve order.  

=item $stat->maxdex();

Returns the index of the maximum value of the data set.  
The index returned is the first occurence of the maximum value.

Note: the index is determined by the order data was added using 
C<add_data()> or C<add_data_tuple()>. It is meaningless in context of 
C<get_data()> as C<get_data()> does not return values in the same
order in which they were added.  This behavior is different than 
Statistics::Descriptive which does preserve order.  

=item $stat->count();

Returns the total number of elements in the data set.

=item $stat->uniq();

Returns the total number of unique elements in the data set.
For example, if your data set is (1,2,2,3,3,3), uniq will 
return 3.  This function is specific to Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete
and is not implemented in Statistics::Descriptive.

=item $stat->sum();

Returns the sum of all the values in the data set.

=item $stat->mean();

Returns the mean of the data.

=item $stat->harmonic_mean();

Returns the harmonic mean of the data.  Since the mean is undefined
if any of the data are zero or if the sum of the reciprocals is zero,
it will return undef for both of those cases.

=item $stat->geometric_mean();

Returns the geometric mean of the data.  Returns C<undef> if any of the data
are less than 0. Returns 0 if any of the data are 0.

=item $stat->median();

Returns the median value of the data.

=item $stat->mode();

Returns the mode of the data.

=item $stat->variance();

Returns the variance of the data.

=item $stat->standard_deviation();

Returns the standard_deviation of the data.

=item $stat->sample_range();

Returns the sample range (max - min) of the data set.

=item $stat->frequency_distribution_ref($num_partitions);

=item $stat->frequency_distribution_ref(\@bins);

=item $stat->frequency_distribution_ref();

C<frequency_distribution_ref($num_partitions)> slices the data into
C<$num_partitions> sets (where $num_partitions is greater than 1) and counts
the number of items that fall into each partition. It returns a reference to a
hash where the keys are the numerical values of the partitions used. The
minimum value of the data set is not a key and the maximum value of the data
set is always a key. The number of entries for a particular partition key are
the number of items which are greater than the previous partition key and less
then or equal to the current partition key. As an example,

   $stat->add_data(1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4);
   $f = $stat->frequency_distribution_ref(2);
   for (sort {$a <=> $b} keys %$f) {
      print "key = $_, count = $f->{$_}\n";
   }

prints

   key = 2.5, count = 4
   key = 4, count = 3

since there are four items less than or equal to 2.5, and 3 items
greater than 2.5 and less than 4.

C<frequency_distribution_refs(\@bins)> provides the bins that are to be used
for the distribution.  This allows for non-uniform distributions as
well as trimmed or sample distributions to be found.  C<@bins> must
be monotonic and must contain at least one element.  Note that unless the
set of bins contains the full range of the data, the total counts returned will
be less than the sample size.

Calling C<frequency_distribution_ref()> with no arguments returns the last
distribution calculated, if such exists.

=item my %hash = $stat->frequency_distribution($partitions);

=item my %hash = $stat->frequency_distribution(\@bins);

=item my %hash = $stat->frequency_distribution();

Same as C<frequency_distribution_ref()> except that it returns the hash
clobbered into the return list. Kept for compatibility reasons with previous
versions of Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete and using it is discouraged.

Note: in earlier versions of Statistics:Descriptive::Discrete, C<frequency_distribution()>
behaved differently than the Statistics::Descriptive implementation.  Any code that uses
this function should be carefully checked to ensure compatability with the current 
implementation.


=item $stat->get_data();

Returns a copy of the data array.  Note: This array could be
very large and would thus defeat the purpose of using this
module.  Make sure you really need it before using get_data().

The returned array contains the values sorted by value.  It does
not preserve the order in which the values were added.  Preserving
order would defeat the purpose of this module which trades speed
and memory usage over preserving order.  If order is important,
use Statistics::Descriptive.

=item $stat->clear();

Clears all data and resets the instance as if it were newly created

Effectively the same as

  my $class = ref($stat);
  undef $stat;
  $stat = new $class;

The interface for this module strives to be identical to Statistics::Descriptive.  
Any differences are noted in the description for each method.
