Statistics/Descriptive/Discrete version 0.01
============================================

Calculates descriptive statistics for discrete data sets (e.g. data 
sets with a known, discrete number of values or levels in the data,
such as the output of an analog-to-digital conversion).

The interface is very similar (almost identical) to Statistics::Descriptive
but the performance is an order of magnitude better when the data set is very
large relative to the number of discrete values in the data set.  

For example, a data set with 2.6 million numbers but only 256 discrete values
took 561 seconds to process with Statistics::Descriptive but on 40 seconds
to process with Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete.
